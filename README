TestNative Threads POC
======================

This is a POC that shows that Java applications can use Threaded Building Blocks (TBB) to manage threading according to TBBs paradigm. 
Thread workers can be written in Java, and it's possible to build a library that gives the TBB functionality to ordinary Java (or Groovy, JRuby, Jython, Scala?) apps.

To use:
- you'll need the GCC toolchain and a JDK, configured into your path. Also, TBB configured.
(You may need to edit the makefile for your version).

- checkout the TestNativeThreads and nativethread projects

- build nativethread (cd to nativethread/Debug and make)

- run TestThread.main with the -Djava.library.path=<blah>/nativethread/Debug option to tell it where to find libraries
